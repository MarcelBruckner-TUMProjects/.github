# TUM Projects

Find here all projects I did during my studies:
- **[Automated Camera Stabilization and Calibration for Intelligent Transportation Systems](https://github.com/MarcelBruckner-TUMProjects/Automated-Camera-Stabilization-and-Calibration-for-Intelligent-Transportation-Systems)**:  
  These projects were developed as part of the [Providentia++](https://innovation-mobility.com/projekt-providentia/) research project during my Guided Research at the [Chair of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Real-Time Systems](https://www.in.tum.de/en/i06/home/).  
  - **[Static Calibration](https://github.com/MarcelBruckner-TUMProjects/StaticCalibration)** focuses on the static calibration of sensor data, particularly to improve positioning accuracy in autonomous driving systems.  
  - **[Dynamic Stabilization](https://github.com/MarcelBruckner-TUMProjects/DynamicStabilization)** deals with stabilizing sensor measurements in dynamic environments to ensure consistent and precise data acquisition.

- **[OpenDRIVE](https://github.com/MarcelBruckner-TUMProjects/OpenDRIVE)**:  
  A side project of my Guided Research, implementing a parser for the [OpenDRIVE 1.6](https://www.asam.net/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=3495&token=56b15ffd9dfe23ad8f759523c806fc1f1a90a0e8#) standard.  
  - OpenDRIVE is a widely used format for describing road networks and environmental data in autonomous driving simulations.  
  - The parser extracts landmarks and lanes from OpenDRIVE files for use in the calibration process.

- **[Volumetric-Fusion](https://github.com/MarcelBruckner-TUMProjects/Volumetric-Fusion)**:  
  In this practical project, I developed a complete 3D reconstruction pipeline using a multi-camera setup.  
  - The pipeline includes all steps from image preprocessing and 3D registration of cameras to shape reconstruction using a voxel grid approach.  
  - Volumetric fusion techniques are widely used in computer vision for applications such as 3D scanning, augmented reality, and robotics.

- **[GAIL 4 BARK](https://github.com/GAIL-4-BARK/bark-ml)**:  
  During an internship at [fortiss](https://www.fortiss.org/), I implemented [Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03476) agents for the [BARK simulator](https://github.com/bark-simulator/bark).  
  - GAIL is an imitation learning method that allows agents to learn behavior strategies by observing expert demonstrations.  
  - The BARK simulator is a platform for autonomous vehicle simulations, used for research and validation of control algorithms.

- **[Generalization-Ideas-in-Deep-Learning](https://github.com/MarcelBruckner-TUMProjects/Generalization-Ideas-in-Deep-Learning)**:  
  In this seminar, I explored different measures for the generalization ability of neural networks.  
  - Generalization refers to how well a trained model can handle new, unseen data without overfitting.  
  - I analyzed various techniques to improve generalization, including regularization methods and architectural designs.

- **[Capstone-Project](https://github.com/MarcelBruckner-TUMProjects/Capstone-Project)**:  
  My first semester project and overall my very first project: A terminal-based maze game with procedurally generated levels.  
  - Features include enemies, traps, keys, and doors, along with a side-scrolling mechanic controlled via arrow keys.  
  - This project served as an introduction to game development and algorithm design, particularly in procedural generation.
